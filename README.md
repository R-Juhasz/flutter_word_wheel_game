Word Wheel Game
Overview
"Word Wheel Game" is an engaging mobile app designed to challenge your vocabulary and quick thinking. This game was built as part of an interview process, which I successfully passed, demonstrating my skills in developing fun and interactive applications. Players must form words from letters arranged in a dynamic wheel, using a specified central letter as part of each word. The game is designed to be both fun and educational, enhancing word recognition and cognitive speed.

Features
Dynamic Word Wheels: Each game generates a new word wheel from a predefined list of words, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
Timed Challenges: Games are timed, adding an exciting pressure element. Players must think quickly to maximize their score before time runs out.
Score Tracking: The game tracks scores, allowing players to see their progress and aim to beat their high scores.
Engaging UI: The game features a colorful and intuitive interface with animations that make the gameplay more engaging.
Technologies Used
Flutter: Used for cross-platform mobile app development.
Dart: All game logic and UI components are implemented using Dart.
Custom Painters: Used for drawing the game wheel and other UI elements dynamically.
